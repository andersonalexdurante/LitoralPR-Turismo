# Litoral PR - Turismo

### :ocean: In order to learn maps and animations to use in my react native applications, I developed this app of turism for my region

##### :computer: Backend made of pure Node with Express and Knex using SQL database. 
##### :iphone: Mobile frontend using Expo and Axios for the API consume.

For the animations I used the Airbnb package [Lottie](https://github.com/react-native-community/lottie-react-native), that allow us to use native animations in our applications using just JSON.
[React-Native-Maps](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps) uses default native maps components of the devices, both Android or iOS, keeping the navigation smooth and polished.
